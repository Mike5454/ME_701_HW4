In problem number 3 you need to run give[#] where # refers to the list desired. 0 for Atomic Number, 1 for Atomic Symbol, 
2 for Mass Number, and 3 for Standard Atomic Weight.

Because there are so many numbers and they tend to get cut-off in python I also provided an atomic mass alternative file 
that will output all of the lists on a text file. This could be useful if these numbers were to be copied into a spreadsheet. 
Problem 3 seemed a little vague with how you wanted the lists so I hope this is what you wanted.
